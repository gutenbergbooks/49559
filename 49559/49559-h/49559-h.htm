<h2><a name="PRELIMINARY_NOTE" id="PRELIMINARY_NOTE"></a>PRELIMINARY NOTE</h2>


<p>JOHN RUSKIN has laid down some broad and simple rules which
are especially applicable to DESIGN IN JEWELLERY AND
FANS. He says, "Never encourage the manufacture of any article
not absolutely necessary, in the production of which invention
has no share." And, again, "Never encourage imitation, or
copying of any kind, except for the sake of preserving records of
great works."</p>

<p>It is in the thorough belief of the soundness or these principles that
the Editor has selected a number of representative modern examples
of design by British and Continental workers, which, from their
beauty and freshness of treatment, bear testimony to the great advance
that has recently been made in the right understanding and rendering
of the jeweller's and fan-maker's arts. If articles of good taste are to
be produced, there must be a demand for them. So long as a public
is to be found that will purchase trinketry in imitation of wheel-barrows,
cocks and hens, flower-pots, and moons and stars, so long
will the advance in art be retarded.</p>

<p>The Editor has pleasure in acknowledging the courtesy of the
owners of copyrights for their kindness in sanctioning the
reproduction of important work; and his best thanks are due
to all the artist-contributors, and especially to those who have
made designs expressly for this publication.</p>

<h2><a name="MODERN_FRENCH_JEWELLERY" id="MODERN_FRENCH_JEWELLERY"></a>MODERN FRENCH JEWELLERY
&amp; FANS. <span class="smcap">By</span> GABRIEL MOUREY.</h2>

<p><span class="float1" style="width: 103px;">
<img src="images/drop-f.png" alt="F" class="floatl" height="140" width="103" /></span><span class="hidden">F</span>RENCH superiority in the art of jewellery seems
to be incontestable to-day. No unbiased observer will deny the fact
that with us there is more richness, more variety, more originality
than can be found elsewhere; and the jewellery section in the
Esplanade des Invalides at the Exhibition of 1900 showed to the whole
world the progress made in this special branch of applied art by our
craftsmen and our artists; showed, too, the verve, the imagination,
the fancifulness, which are the special property of the French race
in all that relates to articles of luxury, to those things which are
essentially "useless," if so we may term a woman's adornments; if so
we may regard the beauty of precious stones, of enamels skilfully and
subtly formed&mdash;of all that, in a word, which, taken from Nature's
infinite treasure-house, serves to constitute that adorably vain, that
exquisitely superfluous thing&mdash;the jewel. Ruskin once remarked, in
his strange, penetrating way, that the loveliest things are those which
are the least useful&mdash;lilies and peacocks' feathers, for instance.
Furthermore, to depreciate the part played by jewellery in relation to
decorative art would be equivalent to minimising the rôle of womankind
in civilisation. Then, again, as regards decoration or adornment, has
not the highest mission devolved on woman? Has she not had to assume
the most active part in it all? The modern jewellery vogue has, I am
convinced, done more in France to propagate new ideas in the way of
decorative art than all the æsthetic theories ever evolved, however
sound.</p>

<p>One might say much, might make many reflections on this
renascence of the jeweller's art, as manifested at the present moment
in Paris. This revival reveals itself rich and abundant&mdash;perhaps too
rich and abundant; but what of the future? What fruit will it
bear when the glamour of that which it has already borne has
passed away? Is there no danger of seeing good intentions miscarry&mdash;high
gifts falling into excesses injurious to the prosperity of the
movement? Is not the new fashion&mdash;if it be merely a fashion&mdash;being
adopted with too much enthusiasm, followed with too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
ardour, to last? Is there no fear of a reaction? Here are several
questions to which we cannot reply with any certainty.</p>

<p>Yet, what matter? Among the works produced during the
past five years or so&mdash;that is, since the full expansion of the
movement&mdash;there are many which, by their originality, their
technical perfection, deserve to remain. And remain they certainly
will, to bear witness to the audacious fancy, the creative faculty
of our artists, and as a sort of passionate homage laid by the men
of to-day at the feet of the Eternal Feminine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The name of M. René Lalique arises instinctively as soon as
one begins to discuss the modern jewel. He is the renovator,
or, preferably, the creator, of the art as we know it nowadays, and
one can easily understand the enthusiasm and the admiration aroused
by his work. M. Lalique is almost as celebrated as M. Edmond
Rostand; and he at least deserves his celebrity, for he is a real, a
very great, artist. And such he must indeed be to be able to make
one forget his imitators, many of whose productions are as detestable
as copies can be. At times even&mdash;most unjustly, I admit&mdash;one
almost comes to hate the art of M. Lalique himself, so
persistently is it badly imitated. One has been constrained before
now to hate Raphael, on seeing a Cabanel or a Bouguereau! But
enough of that!</p>

<p>The jewels by M. Lalique now reproduced are rather different,
both in conception and in treatment, from his usual manner. Here
he appears as a more direct observer of Nature, more devoted to
simplicity and breadth. His new combs, with pansy&mdash;and sycamore-leaf
<em>motifs</em>, in horn and silver&mdash;especially the exquisite one with
sycamore seeds in horn, silex, black enamel, and obsidian, with
golden insects here and there&mdash;show him still anxious to extend the
field of his experiments, never tired of seeking fresh subjects and
testing new materials. Instead of remaining stationary and falling
asleep at his post, he is spurred by a desire for conquest, and shows
himself ever fertile in imagination, of infinite fancy, constantly
advancing, with undiminished freedom and originality.</p>

<p>At the Universal Exhibition the works executed by M. Vever, in
collaboration with M. Eugène Grasset, obtained the success that
was their due. But the most important piece of work achieved by
these two artists was not finished at that time. I refer to the
sumptuous and heroic pendant of Hercules, which we are fortunate
enough to be able to reproduce here from the original water-colour
by M. Grasset. It is truly an admirable work, one in which all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
imaginative and technical qualities possessed by the illustrator of the
"Quatre Fils Aymon" are to be seen in profusion. What richness,
what distinction in the details; what perfection of balance, both in
design and in colouring! As for the execution by the firm of Vever,
they deserve as much credit for it as if they had produced an original
work. This is a jewel worthy to find a permanent place in one of
the great European galleries, to rank side by side with the wonderful
productions of the past.</p>

<p>M. Georges Fouquet is a most daring <em>fantaisiste</em>, and his
creations impress one by qualities altogether different from those of
the MM. Vever. He might perhaps be said to belong to the
Lalique school, not that he imitates him, but by reason of his
imaginative gifts. He is generally complicated, somewhat
Byzantine, and thoroughly modern in any case. Some of his
jewels would, I think, gain by being less rich; nevertheless, they
are very interesting, and they deserve all the success they have
won. The chief objection that can be urged against them is
their lack of spontaneity. M. Georges Fouquet certainly holds a
foremost place in the new movement. Already his production is
considerable. Altogether an artist of rare gifts and splendid
audacity.</p>

<p>I have always had a liking for the jewellery of M. Colonna&mdash;for
some of it, at any rate, that which is most simple, most original, and
most wearable. His works have this great charm in my eyes, that
they are neither show-case jewels nor mere <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bijoux de parade</i>, things
intended solely for display. As a rule, they are quiet and practical.
In most cases they have no "subject," being simply happy
combinations of lines and curves and reliefs, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">imprévu</i> of which
has a particular charm.</p>

<p>M. Marcel Bing, all of whose productions, like those of M.
Colonna, are the monopoly of the "Art Nouveau Bing," has done
some delightful things. One can see that he is still somewhat timid
and hesitating, but his taste is sure, and he has an imagination
which, if not specially abundant, is at least delicate and fine. He
has a sense of colour too, and his pretty fancies are carried out with
evident delight.</p>

<p>"La Maison Moderne," so actively directed by M.
Meier-Graefe, has produced a large number of jewels. Ordinarily
the designs are supplied by MM. Maurice Dufrène, Paul Follot,
and Orazzi. Of course, they are not of uniform merit, but this in
no way diminishes the interest attaching to their efforts. They are
marred to some extent, it must be admitted, by certain extravagances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
but even that is better than a relapse into the old <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">formulæ</i>, or the
profitless reproduction of the bad models which were the rage
some thirty years since. Moreover, "La Maison Moderne"&mdash;all
praise to it!&mdash;has brought within the reach of the public quantities
of jewellery which, without being masterpieces of conception or
execution, are yet thoroughly good work based on excellent
principles of novelty and freshness. They are what may be
termed "popular" jewels.</p>

<p>The works designed by M. Théodore Lambert, and executed by
M. Paul Templier, are of altogether different character. In these
days, when excessive complications in jewel-work are so general and
so much esteemed, these rings, necklaces and <em>plaques</em>, with their
symmetrical linear designs in monochrome or reddish or greenish
metal, relieved at times by pearls only, and with their formal
<em>ajourements</em>, will doubtless seem to many people too simple or
too commonplace. It will be justly urged against them that they
are not sufficiently symbolic, that they take no account of the human
form. No nymph disports herself amid the fall of the leaves in a
lake of enamel bordered by water-lilies and iris blooms; no serpent
nor devil-fish winds about in spasmodic contortions: yet these are
charming works of art, beautifully and harmoniously designed, and
with lines balanced to perfection. They are, in fact, jewels meant
to be worn, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bijoux de ville</i>, which, while attracting no special
notice, form nevertheless most exquisite objects of female adornment.</p>

<p>M. René Foy is a strange artist, rather restless, never altogether
satisfied with himself, and haunted by a perpetual desire for something
novel. Is he completely himself, that which he wishes or
strives to be? This is the question those who have closely watched
his career are asking themselves. For my part, I know some delightful
things of his, extraordinarily delicate and graceful; but I also
remember some of his work in which his exaggerations are such
that one despairs of understanding his meaning. Unless I greatly
mistake him, he wants the jewel to express more than it is possible
for the jewel to express, and therefore is continually restless in his
attempts to achieve the unachievable. He loses himself in a maze
of "refinements" which, in my opinion, are outside the limits of the
art he practises. He has created lovely things, things so novel as
to be almost too novel, but I do not think he has said his final word
yet. He is a young man who may have many surprises in store
for us.</p>

<p>The jewels of M. Jules Desbois are works of pure sculpture. His
vision, at once broad and delicate, takes the form of beautiful female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
forms in dreamy or voluptuous attitude, sleeping amid the masses of
their abundant hair, against a background of gold, or shell, or whatever
the material may be. Any womanly gesture suffices; and, in
truth, what more is needed to make a real work of art in the form
of a brooch or a button? No conventional flowers, no complicated
interlacements, nothing "decorative" in the bad sense of the word;
yet his work is powerfully and delicately modern. M. Desbois'
jewels are perfect pieces of sculpture.</p>

<p>Victor Prouvé, the painter, has been influenced in a similar
way, but, not being a regular sculptor, he is more complicated
without being any more original on that account. There is more
"composition" in his jewels than in those of M. Desbois, more real,
more visible, intention. His waistbelts, his brooches, &amp;c., are
admirably suited to the purpose for which they are intended, their
modelling being full, supple, and keen. The jewels, executed with
scrupulous care and irreproachable <em>technique</em> by M. Rivaud, are
real works of art.</p>

<p>M. Bécker and M. Paul Richard, who are both working almost
exclusively for M. Ferdinand Verger ("F. V." is the trademark of
the firm), incline to that type of jewellery which might be termed
"sculptured." They are very conscientious artists, but in my
opinion, at any rate, the originality there may be within them has
not yet made itself fully apparent.</p>

<p>M. Louis Bonny's jewels deserve special attention. Like
M. Vever, M. Bonny shows a predilection for precious stones,
which he has the art of using with rare originality. At the last
<em>salon</em> of the Société des Artistes Français he exhibited a series of
jewels which attracted much attention, among them&mdash;in addition
to a beautiful necklace of wild grape in enamel, diamonds, and
emerald, in addition to various floral pendants and neck ornaments
in enamel and diamonds&mdash;a curious diadem, representing cocks in
gold and enamel fighting for possession of a superb topaz. This was
a real <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tour de force</i> in the way of execution. Other beautiful things
of his I know, particularly his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plaque de cou</i> of geraniums, with the
leaves in diamonds, the flowers in rubies, the stems and buds in dark
green enamel, the whole being at once rich and sober in colouring
and most harmoniously and flexibly composed.</p>

<p>M. Joé Descomps is a sound artist, whose efforts, laudable as
they may be, nevertheless lack boldness. He has imagination
enough, but it looks as though he feared to give it rein. With a
little less timidity M. Descomps would doubtless produce something
more piquant and more fresh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>I greatly like the work of M. Charles Rivaud. It displays a
love of simplicity too often wanting in the productions of many of
his fellow artists. If his jewels recall&mdash;without imitating&mdash;the
ornamental jewellery of Egypt or Greece, those of primitive civilisations
or those sorts popular in Russia, I can see no harm in the
fact. Better for him and for us that he should turn to these
inexhaustible springs than become a mere imitator of other imitators
of successful jewellers. His rings and his necklaces, in which he
is always careful to leave to the materials employed all the natural
charm they possess, are productions which will please the artist rather
than the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgeois</i> and the "snob." They are discreet and honest,
never loud or eccentric.</p>

<p>No less interesting, in another way, are the jewels by M. Mangeant
and M. Jacquin. It is urged against them that they are crude,
incomplete and imperfect in execution. The truth is, these two
artists&mdash;whom I bring into conjunction, although their work is
dissimilar, save from their common regard for freedom in the use of
materials&mdash;have, above all, a love for natural forms. Out of a
flower, a piece of seaweed, or any humble <em>motif</em>, vegetable or
animal, they construct jewels in gold or oxidised silver, discreetly
relieved by stones, which, if of no great intrinsic value, are
nevertheless highly decorative. M. Mangeant, with mother-of-pearl
and hammered <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">repoussé</i> silver, has created charming jewels, in which
all the constructive parts have been intentionally left visible.
Professional jewellers shrug their shoulders at the sight of these
jewels, which bear so plainly the stamp of the hand that fashioned
them. Yet, in their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïve</i> rudeness, they appeal to me far more
forcibly than does the polychromatic tin-ware of so many highly-esteemed
producers.</p>

<p>M. Charles Boutet de Monvel, although gifted with a richer and
subtler imagination, may be included in this little group. In certain
of his jewels there is, as it were, a reminiscence of Byzantine
art&mdash;in this owl-comb, for instance, which I regard as one of his
best works. His swan hair-pin, his seaweed buttons in gold and silver
on greenish enamel with a pearl in the centre, his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">plaque de cou</i>
in translucid enamel, are also strong and captivating. His sunshade
handles too, and his scarf-pins, are full of delicate fancy.</p>

<p>It is impossible, within the space at my disposal, to describe
in detail the productions of many other workers well worthy of
extended mention. Let it suffice, therefore, to cite the names of
M. Henri Nocq, that fresh and bold artist; of M. and Mme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Pierre Selmersheim; M. Feuillâtre; Mme. Annie Noufflard;
MM. Haas, Cherrier, Chalon, Falguières, Dabault, G. Laffitte,
Houillon, Archambault, L. H. Ruffe, Quénard, Blanchot, Muret,
Desrosiers, Le Couteux, Marioton, Lucien Hirtz, and Nau&mdash;artists
who work, some on their own account, some for the big jewellery
firms.</p>

<p>Of the firms in question one must in justice name in the first place
those of Boucheron and Falize frères, not forgetting L. Aucoc,
Vever, Sandoz, Lucien Gaillard, Fouquet, Després, Teterger,
Chaumet, Templier, Ferdinand Verger, J. Duval, Coulon, and
Piel frères.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, is the modern art-jewellery movement in France.
Its intensity, as one sees, is so great as to be almost alarming.
Whither is it tending? Some of its excesses are dangerous; what
will be the result? M. Emile Molinier, in a recent article on
"Objects of Art in the Salons of 1901," expresses certain fears which
I share. He dreads a reaction due to the eccentricities of certain
artists, to their love of the outrageous and the <em>bizarre</em>, to their lack
of proportion, both in form and in choice of material.</p>

<p>"It would really be a pity," he says, "if so promising a revival of
the true artistic jewellery should come to a bad end. Happily we
have not reached that point yet, but it is a result which may soon
be reached if artists continue to foist these weird things on the
public. A fashion in jewellery should last longer than a fashion
in dresses or in hats; but it should not be forgotten that it must
rely in the long run on its appropriateness and adaptability." My
sincere hope is that these fears may prove to be groundless.</p>

<h2><a name="MODERN_BRITISH_JEWELLERY" id="MODERN_BRITISH_JEWELLERY"></a>MODERN BRITISH JEWELLERY
&amp; FANS. <span class="smcap">By</span> AYMER VALLANCE.</h2>

<p><span class="float1" style="width: 131px;">
<img src="images/drop-n.png" alt="N" class="floatl" height="140" width="131" /></span><span class="hidden">N</span>ONE but the most superficial observers can have failed to note the
immense advance that has been attained in British jewellery; though how
or at what precise point of time the improvement originated may not be
determined with too rash precision. It began not more than fifteen or
twenty, nor perhaps later than ten years ago. Somewhere between these
two limits is about the approximate date. At any rate, it is certain
that, thirty years since, it was quite impossible to procure jewellery
in the design and composition of which there entered any artistic taste
whatever. Such simply did not exist. Whereas now there is a widespread,
though unhappily not a universal, movement amongst us for the design and
production of jewellery on true æsthetic principles. The movement may
even be described as in a measure concerted, that is, in so far as it
presents certain main characteristics common to the work of the various
individual artists or schools of artists who are concerned with this
branch of decoration.</p>

<p>And, firstly, must be noted the development of the goldsmith's and
silversmith's craft as an important artistic factor entirely distinct
and apart from the subsidiary task of stone-setting. The recognition of
the art of the metal-worker, as worthy and capable in itself of
providing beautiful ornaments, without their serving any such ulterior
purpose as sporting trophies or eccentric badges of buffoonery; and also
without the adventitious attraction of costly gems, is a decided point
gained.</p>

<p>And, secondly, where stones do happen to be employed, there is an
increasing practice of introducing them for the sake of their decorative
properties, not, as formerly, for the commercial value they represent
in pounds sterling. Mere glitter and the vulgar display of affluence are
gradually yielding before the higher considerations of beauty of form
and colour. Nor is it any longer deemed improper, should the æsthetic
effect of the juxtaposition demand, to set diamonds or other valuable
gems side by side with common and inexpensive stones. In these colour
combinations, since flash and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[2]</a></span>transparence are become of minor esteem,
jewels, instead of being cut in facets, are not infrequently polished in
their natural shape, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en cabochon</i>, or "tallow-cut," as it is called,
their irregularities of formation imparting not a little to the barbaric
richness of the ornaments in which they occur.</p>

<p>Moreover, out of the taste for colour effects in jewellery has arisen an
enthusiastic study of the special peculiarities of many gems not
hitherto much sought after; a study resulting in the adoption of certain
gems not very precious, yet sufficiently rare, and such that, like
Mexican or fire opals, for example, possess peculiar qualities of
chameleon-like iridescence or depth or lustre that render them admirably
appropriate for quaint and picturesque settings. Among other stones thus
employed may be mentioned lapis lazuli; malachite and its corresponding
blue mineral, azurite; Connemara marble, or serpentine; amazonite, a
light green spar; chrysoprase; and lumachella, Hungarian both in name
and origin. The last named consists of fossilised shells imbedded in a
black matrix, the shells of wonderful iridescence, or flecked with
streaks of vivid colour, and possessing, in short, such ornamental
qualities as amply compensate the difficulty of obtaining it and of
working when obtained. Another material included in the same category is
river pearl, or mother-of-pearl, in the form technically known as pearl
"blisters," that is, pearls undeveloped in the shell and misshapen,
which nevertheless are peculiarly useful for decorative jewellery. One
advantage of these substances is that, on account of their comparative
cheapness, one does not scruple to diminish and divide and fashion them
as may best serve the purpose in hand; whereas in the case of the more
precious stones, like diamonds, whose cost, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ceteris paribus</i>, increases
proportionately with their size and weight, one shrinks from impairing
their commercial value, and consequently is apt to preserve them whole,
very often at the sacrifice of decorative effect. The craftsman is
unhampered in the use of those jewels only which he knows he is at
liberty to treat as adjuncts subordinated to his art.</p>

<p>There has, moreover, taken place an extended revival of enamelling, an
art which offers abundant opportunities for the exercise of the
decorator's skill and fancy. It is worthy of remark that our artists'
imagination in jewellery seldom degenerates into any great extravagance.
For the most part the designs, even among beginners and students in art
schools, a number of whom have taken up this branch of ornament, are
strictly restrained within bounds, in accord, may be, with our national
character of reserve. Few drawings comparatively have been executed, but
there is no reason <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[3]</a></span>why a large proportion should not be translated from
paper into actual existence; for they are in general fairly simple,
straightforward, and practicable, or such that, with but slight
modifications, could be rendered quite practicable for working purposes.</p>

<p>It is often stated that art can only flourish through the patronage of
the wealthy, to whose comfort and luxury it ministers. If this be true
at all, then surely of all things in the world the jeweller's craft
should be a case in point, whereas it is conspicuously the reverse. The
artistic jewellery produced in this country has not, from its very
nature, appealed chiefly to the richest classes of the community, but
rather to those of quite moderate means. And while, on the one hand, it
is encouraging to observe how much of good work has been and is being
done towards raising the standard of jewellery design amongst us, it is
nevertheless disappointing to have to record how little support it has
found in influential and official quarters. One notable exception is the
commission Mr. Alfred Gilbert received to design a mayoral collar, chain
and badge for the Corporation of Preston. The sketch model for the same
was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1888, and, for bold originality of
outline, as well as for the crisp curling treatment of the parts
executed in sheet metal, must have been, as was remarked at the time, a
revelation to the ordinary trade jeweller.</p>

<p>Among pioneers of the artistic jewellery movement, Mr. C. R. Ashbee
holds an honourable place. He stood almost alone at the beginning, when
he first made known the jewellery designed by him, and produced under
his personal direction by the Guild and School of Handicraft in the East
End. It was immediately apparent that here was no tentative nor
half-hearted caprice, but that a genuine and earnest phase of an ancient
craft had been re-established. Every design was carefully thought out,
and the work executed with not less careful and consistent technique. In
fact, its high merits were far in advance of anything else in
contemporary jewellery or goldsmith's work. The patterns were based on
conventionalised forms of nature, favourite among them being the
carnation, the rose, and the heartsease, or on abstract forms invited by
the requirements and conditions of the material&mdash;the ductility and
lustre of the metal itself. Most of the ornaments were of silver, the
surface of which was not worked up to a brilliantly shining burnish, in
the prevalent fashion of the day, but dull polished in such wise as to
give the charming richness and tone of old silverwork. Mr. Ashbee also
adopted the use of jewels, not lavishly nor ostentatiously, but just
wherever a note of colour would <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[4]</a></span>convey the most telling effect, the
stones in themselves, <i>e.g.</i> amethysts, amber, and rough pearl, being of
no particular value, save purely from the point of view of decoration.
Novel and revolutionary as were, at its first appearance, the principles
underlying Mr. Ashbee's jewellery work&mdash;viz. that the value of a
personal ornament consists not in the commercial cost of the materials
so much as in the artistic quality of its design and treatment&mdash;they
became the standard which no artist thenceforward could wisely afford to
ignore, and such furthermore that have even in certain quarters become
appropriated by the trade in recent times. Mr. Ashbee himself is an
enthusiastic student of Benvenuto Cellini, whose treatises he
translated, edited, and printed in 1898. But fortunately the influence
of Italian style is by no means paramount in Mr. Ashbee's own designs
for jewellery, unless indeed the fine and dainty grace which
particularly characterises some of his later work is to be attributed to
this source. One or two of the necklaces here reproduced are examples of
this lighter manner of Mr. Ashbee's, as the two handsome peacock pattern
brooches are of his more solid and substantial jewellery; while, again,
the necklace of green malachite, turquoise, and silver, with pendants of
grape bunches alternating with vine-leaf and tendril ornaments, occupies
an intermediate position midway between the two former classes of his
work.</p>

<p>One is always glad to welcome an artist who is courageous and firm
enough to grapple with the practical difficulties that surround him, and
who sets about to reform, where need requires, the native industry of
his own neighbourhood. Such is the aim of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Gaskin.
Their home is in a locality where a large amount of very deplorable
jewellery is produced; so deplorable that they determined, if possible,
to provide an antidote to the prevailing degradation. And the reason why
the vast mass of the trade jewellery manufactured in Birmingham is bad
is that in style and outline it is utterly devoid of artistic
inspiration, while at the same time it is perfect as concerns mere
technique. The pity of it is that such excellent workmanship should be
wasted on such contemptible design. Mr. Gaskin, therefore, saw no
alternative but to start afresh, reversing the accepted order of things.
His plan is to give the foremost care to the design, and only secondly
to regard technique; and so, by keeping design well in advance,
executive skill following after, to raise the former to its proper
level. Absence of mathematical uniformity is no doubt held to be a
blemish in the opinion of the tradesman, but it gives a living and human
interest to the work, and a decorative quality which machine-made
articles <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[5]</a></span>cannot claim to possess. Mr. Gaskin came to the conclusion
that it was of little benefit for a draughtsman to make drawings on
paper to be carried out by someone else; studio and workshop must be
one, designer identical with craftsman. It is not very many years since
Mr. Gaskin, ably seconded by his wife, started with humble, nay, almost
rudimentary apparatus, to make jewellery with his own hands; but the
result has proved how much taste and steadfast endurance can accomplish.
Their designs are so numerous and so varied&mdash;rarely is any single one
repeated, except to order&mdash;that it is hardly possible to find any
description to apply to all. But it may be noted that, whereas a large
number have been characterised by a light and graceful treatment of
twisted wire, almost like filigree, the two pendants here illustrated
seem to indicate rather a new departure on the part of Mr. Gaskin, with
their plates of chased metal, and pendants attached by rings, a method
not in any sense copied from, yet in some sort recalling the beautiful
fashion with which connoisseurs are familiar in Norwegian and Swedish
peasant jewellery.</p>

<p>Next in order may be mentioned Mr. Fred Robinson. This artist is
actuated by similar ideals as Mr. and Mrs. Gaskin, as is evidenced more
especially by his necklace with bent wire pendants of open-work
arabesque.</p>

<p>Another artist of distinction is Miss Annie McLeish, of Liverpool, whose
jewellery design, particularly in the way in which the several parts are
connected together&mdash;an ornamental feature being made out of the
structural requirement of strengthening and tying together the portions
pierced <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à jour</i>&mdash;is curiously suggestive of the perforated iron guards
of Japanese sword-handles. At the same time, it is not to be implied
that Miss McLeish is at all an imitator of Japanese work. Another point
to be noticed is her decorative use of the human figure, in which regard
two more lady designers, Miss Larcombe and Miss Winifred Hodgkinson,
also excel. The latter, to whose work black-and-white reproduction
scarcely does adequate justice, is stronger in her figure work than in
that which comes easiest to most people&mdash;to wit, the treatment of floral
forms that constitute the subordinate portions of the design.</p>

<p>The number of ladies who have achieved success in jewellery design
proves this, indeed, to be a craft to which a woman's light and dainty
manipulation is peculiarly adapted. Besides those already mentioned one
has only to instance Miss Ethel Hodgkinson and Miss Swindell, who both
contribute graceful designs for hat-pins and other small articles; Miss
Dorothy Hart, whose charming <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[6]</a></span><em>pentacol</em> is executed by herself; Miss
Kate Fisher and Miss McBean, in whose designs for clasps, etc., enamel
is a prominent item; Miss Alabaster, whose beautiful gold brooch,
adorned with blue and green enamel, is based on a <em>motif</em> of trees with
intertwining stems and roots; and Miss Rankin, whose four silver
hat-pins of handsome design, representing a peacock, thistles, and
Celtic beasts respectively, are executed by Mr. Talbot, of Edinburgh,
himself a designer as well as artificer. Miss Edith Pickert, in her
designs for various articles of jewellery, usually employs a fairly
thick outline of metal to enclose a coloured enamel surface. How
diversely one and the same <em>motif</em> may be rendered in different hands is
illustrated by a comparison of Miss Pickert's belt design and Mr. Nelson
Dawson's belt-clasps, both in enamel and both founded on the flower
"love in a mist."</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson Dawson, well known as an eminent metal-worker and active
member of the Society of Arts and Crafts, is also Director of the
Artificers' Guild. Another belt-clasp from his design represents the
delicate form of the harebell plant.</p>

<p>Mr. Edgar Simpson, of Nottingham, is an artist of great gifts, as his
drawings and, still more, the specimens of his actual handiwork here
illustrated fully testify. Many excellent designs lose vigour and
character in the process of execution from the original sketch; but Mr.
Simpson, on the contrary, manages to give his designs additional charm
by the exquisite finish with which he works them out in metal.
Particularly happy is this artist's rendering of dolphins and other
marine creatures; as in the circular pendant where the swirling motion
of water is conveyed by elegant curving lines of silver, with a pearl,
to represent an air-bubble, issuing from the fish's mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. David Veazey's work, including, among other things, a hair comb
decorated with enamel, has a variegated opal-tinted quality of colour;
while Miss Barrie obtains admirable effects in translucent enamel
without backing, after the Russian method. Her design for a belt-clasp
with interlaced ornament and stones is excellent. Other belt-clasps and
buckles are from designs by Mr. Oliver Baker. Some of this strap-work
ornament looks as though it might have been produced by casting from a
model; but, as a matter of fact, it is entirely wrought and folded by
hand.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. McNair's jewellery, as well as that
of Mr. and Mrs. Mackintosh, has that quaint mannerism which one
instinctively associates with the Glasgow school of decorators, as also,
in a still more marked degree, that of Mr. Talwyn Morris, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[7]</a></span>whose
characteristic book-covers are well known. For jewellery, he frequently
elects to work in aluminium. His design is strikingly original in
effect, though on analysis it is found to consist of very simple units,
such as various-sized rectangles overlaid, their boundary lines
interpenetrating; with the occasional apparition of a peacock's
eye-feather or the bird's neck and head in the midst. In these cases a
completer sense of organic unity might be obtained if, instead of a
detached limb, the whole bird were represented, or some other logical
coherence established between the incidents of the composition.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Cook, of West Ham, inserts small slabs of mosaic, after the
Italian mode, only he frankly adopts a purely conventional treatment,
wisely refraining from any approach to pictorial realism.</p>

<p>It is a hopeful sign that in many of the technical art schools
throughout the land students are taking up jewellery design, and not
only that, but in some cases carrying out the actual work themselves. It
is largely due to the same fostering influence that the beautiful art of
enamelling, frequently referred to above, has been developed amongst us,
notably at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, where classes for this
department were inaugurated under the able guidance of Mr. Alexander
Fisher. But if the improvement in jewellery is to be general and
permanent, in order to set it on a secure basis the motive power must
come from within. Much good, therefore, may be expected to result from
the official sanction afforded by the Goldsmiths' Company to the
jewellery work of their Technical Institute, to which a number of very
creditable designs owe their existence. Among others may be singled out
some decorations for watch-backs, a branch of the craft as useful as it
is neglected; those who have taken it up, like Miss Kate Allen, for
instance, being unfortunately but rare exceptions. There is no reason,
however, why everyone who carries a watch should not enjoy in it the
constant companionship of a thing of beauty.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, if our modern art jewellery cannot boast any
conspicuously brilliant features, at any rate it is of a high average
standard. And though, as is the case of all good work, it must needs
share many qualities in common with the noble treasures of the past, it
yet does not assimilate to any historic style. In fine, it is original;
and, withal, there may be traced in most of it a certain family
likeness. It seems almost as if some new-born idea were really beginning
to dominate it with the impress of a distinct nationality, destined to
develop some day into a tradition which future generations may justly
feel it a privilege to follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The case of fans is the exact opposite to that of jewellery. In the
former department, it cannot be said that there exists any sort of
consensus of ideals, nor any paramount type of ornament. And,
notwithstanding the existence amongst us of some few fan-painters of
very considerable repute, their operations remain as yet quite personal
and individualistic. They have no regular following; have founded no
school of decoration. It is, therefore, a subject still open to
determine by what principles the ornament of fans should be guided.</p>

<p>Firstly should be taken into account the peculiar shape of the surface
available for decoration; and, secondly, the fact that this surface is
not a flat plane, but such that must in practice infallibly be broken
into so many set divisions or folds. The latter circumstance is the real
crux of the question, many decorations, otherwise beautiful enough in
the flat, being utterly ruined in effect as soon as they undergo the
ordeal of mounting. Thus it may perhaps seem an ingenious plan to
subdivide the space horizontally, but it must be remembered that every
horizontal line will lose its value when converted, as it must be, into
a series of irregular zigzags. The folding is an essential factor,
without taking which into account no fan decoration can be satisfactory.
In setting out the design, then, it should always be borne in mind that
no sharply defined straight lines are admissible, except those that
radiate from the centre; and that, of curves, concentric ones are the
best, such, that is, as are parallel with the arc shape. If the ornament
is floral, it may take the form either of a powdering, or of an all-over
pattern of moderately small scrolls. Those on a large scale would run
counter to the folds in too emphatic a manner to be agreeable. In figure
subjects, of course, care should be taken so to dispose them that no
important feature like an eye or a nose be split asunder by the lines of
the folds. The larger and more pronounced the pattern, the more
necessary it is to observe these conditions. On the other hand, where
the colouring is of fairly even tone, and without strongly contrasted
masses, or where the design is on a small scale, the surface can the
more safely be spaced out by lines or medallions or cartouches, or other
devices that may commend themselves.</p>

<p>As regards material, there is no question that a silk ground, prepared
with rice-size and stretched, until the decoration is completed, on a
stretcher, offers as suitable a texture as one could desire for delicate
and softly-blended harmonies in water-colour; as the fans of Mr. Conder,
a prolific fan-painter, whose work appeals to a large circle of
admirers, amply testify. The detail <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[9]</a></span>is all Mr. Conder's own, though the
influence of French XVIIIth century ornament is unmistakable.</p>

<p>Miss Syrett again is a clever artist working on somewhat similar lines.
No one, however, who knew her figure compositions in her Slade School
days, productions full of promise, if marred by the attenuated model
with prim, smooth-drawn hair, the type of Carlos Schwabe's illustrations
to "Le Rêve" and "l'Évangile," could have foreseen that Miss Syrett
would develop in the direction of her present work. The reduced
black-and-white illustrations convey no idea of the tender beauty of the
colouring, nor of the exquisite pen-work in brown with which such
features as the faces, hair, and hands are executed.</p>

<p>Another gifted artist is Mr. Brangwyn, who now makes his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">début</i> as a
fan decorator, with a finished painting on silk, and also a crayon study
for the same purpose. His design shows how much individuality an artist
may impart even to work consciously founded on that of a past style.
Here, for example, in the drawing of Cupids shooting their darts at a
pair of lovers, may be recognised the very figures of the Trianon
period, but happily without any of their doll-like affectation and
effeminacy.</p>

<p>Those who recollect Miss Jessie King's drawing in the last winter's
special number of <span class="smcap">The Studio</span>&mdash;her <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pelleas and Mélisande</i>&mdash;in which the
lank forms of Schwabe or Torop were combined with a wealth of accessory
ornament of the artist's own, will scarcely recognise her hand in the
present fan. She seems to be able to pass with marvellous facility from
one fully matured style to another. The elaborate, nay, luxuriant finish
of the whole, to say nothing of separate details such as the
butterflies, the festoons, knots, etc., vividly recall the work of the
late Aubrey Beardsley. It is no derogation of Miss King's remarkable
powers to assert that, but for the existence of Mr. Beardsley, this
drawing of hers would certainly not have been what it is. One could wish
that, for the sake of support to the leaf, more room had been allowed to
the sticks. But, apart from this defect, the dainty care with which
every minute detail is consistently carried out merits little else than
praise.</p>

<p>Miss Christine Angus contributes two designs&mdash;one, in a pictorial style,
for a paper fan, not nearly so decorative as the other, of nude boys and
sweet peas, for painting on silk. Miss Ethel Larcombe's gauze fans are
attractive compositions, which bear tokens of a diligent appreciation of
Granville Fell.</p>

<p>Another kind of fan ornamentation is exemplified by the stencil work of
Mr. Reginald Dick and Mr. Thomas Cook. It is true these <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[10]</a></span>decorations
are in a degree, but only in a slight degree, mechanical. The one
unchangeable element is the white tie-lines of the pattern. For the
rest, no little skill is required of the artist in devising and cutting
his stencil. The number of plates is limited, but the mode adopted of
colouring by hand admits of such variations that no two specimens from
the identical stencil plates would ever be alike. Mr. Dick's fan is
provided with enamelled sticks in keeping with the other parts of the
decoration. Mr. Cook's design is the less characteristic of this
particular method. Indeed, though finished off at either end with a
certain plausibility, the pattern is an obvious repeat, and such that
might very well be the section of a circular dish border.</p>

<p>Less ambitious are the designs for different sorts of lacework by Miss
Hammett and Miss Naylor. Each of these patterns, while keeping strictly
within the limits of the special technique proposed, shows yet much
freshness and fertility of resource. In the one case the design is
floral, in the other the theme is relieved by the introduction of bird
forms into the composition.</p>

<p>To conclude, the scope for decoration that fans afford is so great, and
the possible methods so manifold, that the wonder is there are not many
more artists employed in this industry. It is one well worthy of their
attention; and it is to be hoped that no long time may elapse before the
joint efforts of designers may, in this, as already in other branches of
arts and crafts, result in something like a native style of
ornamentation being evolved.</p>

<h2><a name="MODERN_AUSTRIAN_JEWELLERY" id="MODERN_AUSTRIAN_JEWELLERY"></a>MODERN AUSTRIAN JEWELLERY.
By W. FRED.</h2>

<p><span class="float1" style="width: 132px;">
<img src="images/drop-c.png" alt="C" class="floatl" height="140" width="132" /></span><span class="hidden">C</span>RITICAL examination of the jewellery of
any particular period cannot fail to be practically a chapter of the
history of culture. The popular saying: "Every time has the poet it
deserves," is superficially true, yet holds within itself a certain
element of falsehood, as does pretty well every commonplace proverb
of the same kind. However, if the sentence be slightly modified, as
it very well may be, so that it reads, "Every time has the jewellery
it deserves," there will be absolutely nothing untrue about it, for
the ornaments worn, whether on the dress, the hair, or the person of
the wearer, have always reflected in a marked degree the taste of
their period, and are very distinctly differentiated from those of any
other time, so that changes in fashion imply changes of a more radical
description in popular feeling.</p>

<p>A history of personal ornament is open to many side issues,
and unfolds itself in two different&mdash;indeed, opposite&mdash;directions.
Primitive savages, as is well known, wear ornaments before they
take to clothes. The Fiji islanders sport gold chains round their
necks, and the African negroes in their untamed state load themselves
with every glittering object they can get hold of, looking
upon the multiplication of ornaments as a sign of wealth. Very
different, of course, is the state of civilisation of those who look upon
decoration as an evidence of art culture, and care only for such
ornaments as require the exercise of technical skill in their production,
valuing them in proportion to the amount of that skill
displayed by their craftsmen, rather than the intrinsic value of their
material. The time of the Italian Renaissance is an instance of the
truth of this. As has so often before been the case in the times
of transition which are of inevitable recurrence, our own modern
epoch is characterised by a certain unrest and confusion, in which
many tendencies are contending with each other side by side, and
neutralising, to a great extent, each other's effects. In America, the
Tiffany company seems to aim at producing masses of precious
stones, which will give primarily the impression of the great wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[2]</a></span>
of their owner and producer; whereas, in France, Lalique the jeweller
endeavours rather to throw into the background the actual value of
the jewels, their artistic setting being the first thing to strike the
observer. We in Austria have greater leanings to France than to
America, and precious stones, however great their intrinsic value,
are looked upon as of quite secondary value in modern art-work to
beauty of line and of colour. French influence on Austrian work
cannot fail to be recognised. Its germs fell indeed on a soil of
exceptional fertility, with the result that they have taken root and
borne abundant fruit. It should perhaps, however, be remarked that
those races who are the heirs of a strong art tradition do not need,
as do others less fortunate, to prove the wealth of their inheritance
by the use of lavish ornament. Their inherent artistic culture is
indeed evidenced by the fact that they expect their artists to exercise
their skill on materials less costly than do those who, to a certain
extent, have their reputations still to make. Benvenuto Cellini had
to be content to work in silver, the Americans want to have every
stick or umbrella-handle to be of gold.</p>

<p>If we cast a glance, however hasty and cursory it may be, over the
development of jewellery in Vienna, noting the forms most popular
in that city in past times, it is impossible not to be struck with the
way in which every historical phase of art is reflected in these forms.
The favourite style with Viennese jewellers, and that in which the
most effective, and at the same time the most characteristic, results
have been achieved was undoubtedly the so-called <em>baroque</em>, a term
originally restricted to a precise architecture or art-style alone, but
now loosely applied to characterise any ornamental design of an
unusual kind. It is in this half-serious, half-sportive style, with
its grotesque yet bold effects and its complete freedom from
convention, that the finest pieces of Austrian jewellery have been
produced. At the time of the great Congress of Vienna, when the
representatives of the Powers met in that city to settle the affairs
of Europe after the fall of Napoleon&mdash;that is to say, about one
hundred years later than the first introduction of the <em>baroque</em> style
from Italy, French work, though it was of a crude description,
exercised an influence over Austrian jewellers, and what seemed
like a second renaissance of the art of ornament began in Austria.</p>

<p>The art of jewellery in Austria remained under French influence
almost until the present day&mdash;in fact, throughout the whole of the
19th century&mdash;and it has only been in the last year that Austrian art-industries
have been set free from the foreign yoke which so long
oppressed them, so that the true Viennese style of jewellery has but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[3]</a></span>
rarely come to the fore. Now at last, however, the liberating influence
of the modern spirit is making itself felt in the art of jewellery, as in
everything else; and every ornament produced, whether in precious
stones or in enamel, bears the unmistakable impress of the distinctive
psychic character of our capital city, which even foreigners do not
fail to recognise. The result of this individuality is that a work of
art is indissolubly bound up with the personality of its creator, and
with the idiosyncrasies of the town which was its birthplace.</p>

<p>In Austria men wear very little jewellery, and the only noteworthy
examples of ornaments made for them which can be quoted are a
few rings and charms, the former perhaps adorned with designs in
low-relief. The flat gold circle of the wedding-ring, which can
be easily carried in the waistcoat pocket, and the engagement-ring,
the psychic meaning of which is clear enough, the latter generally
bearing one large diamond or other precious stone, do not afford
much scope for the æsthetic feeling of their makers. A man who
ventures to wear much jewellery is called old-fashioned, but there
are still people who dare to sport a single great diamond or some
other simple ornament on their shirt fronts. A pearl without setting,
an emerald, or so-called sapphire <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en cabochon</i>, are still frequently
seen. The present fashion allowing men to tie their cravats in all
manner of different styles to suit their own particular fancy, has led
to the manufacture of a few varieties of scarf rings which admit of a
certain amount of artistic intertwining of the gold, if it be gold of
which they are made. When the making of jewellery for men is
left to the unfettered imagination of the artist, he generally produces
something quaintly original and fantastic, such as queer figurals,
grotesque masks, comic caricatures of human or half-human figures
or faces, etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is no doubt that there is far more activity
in the production of jewellery for women in Vienna than in almost
any other city. The culture of our town is, indeed, essentially
feminine. The graceful and witty, yet dreamy and passionate, girls
and women of Vienna give to it its distinctive character. A foreigner
who once spent two days only in our capital was yet able to say of
it, that all through his wanderings in its streets and alleys the rhythm
of female culture was sounding in his ears. The men of Vienna
pride themselves more than the French, more even than the people
of Northern Europe, on their women, and as a result of this pride
there is sure to be plenty of beautiful jewellery of varied design to
be met with in the town in which they live.</p>

<p>Amongst jewels and precious stones the spotless white pearl is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[4]</a></span>
perhaps the favourite, but, as proved at the last great Exhibition in
Paris, the pale rose-coloured coral from the East runs it very close.
Diamonds are still set in the old-fashioned way&mdash;that is to say, after
simple designs, the best of which are copies from Renaissance or
<em>baroque</em> models. Only now and then is any attempt made to produce
lightly incised representations direct from Nature of flowers, birds, or
leaves. Of course, bouquets of brilliants and leaves consisting entirely
of diamonds have always been easily made at any period; but what
is now aimed at for that very reason is the evolution of designs
which shall be essentially true to Nature, but at the same time really
artistic. Crude masses of naturalistic flowers are really of no account
whatever, for a bouquet of diamonds can never have the exquisite
charm of a fresh, sweet-smelling bunch of real blossoms. Only a
fairly good design, founded on some flower or leaf which can be
satisfactorily reproduced in, and is, so to speak, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en rapport</i> with, the
jewels to be used, can succeed in pleasing through beauty of form
alone, independently of any association. Good examples of the best
style of ornament in which precious stones are used are the necklace,
figured herewith, with the earrings to match, by Roset and Fischmeister.
In them the natural form, which has been the motive
from which the design was evolved, was the fruit and leaf of the
rare plant known in Germany as the Gingopflanze. The delicate
separate stems are worked in dull gold, and the way the joining is
managed cannot fail to be admired, whilst the single stems are in
platinum. The charm and distinction of this piece of jewellery is
due above all to its beauty of form, in other words it is not the gross
value of the precious stones with which it is set which makes it
a worthy possession, but the skill with which the motive has been
worked out.</p>

<p>Viennese jewellers do not use the colourless precious stones
much. They generally combine jewels with enamel, and also with
what they themselves call the coloured Halbedelsteine, or half-jewels,
such as the agate, onyx, cornelian, and other less valuable precious
stones. The modern tendency is in every case to rely upon colour
and line for effect rather than upon massive form, so that the greater
number of new designs, or of revived designs of the past, require
for their satisfactory treatment what may be almost characterised
as a new technique.</p>

<p>First of all, the modern buckle for the belt or girdle claims
attention. The lately revived custom of wearing the blouse led, as
a matter of course, to the use of the belt with a more or less ornate
buckle, just as, a few years ago, the long necklace came into general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[5]</a></span>
use again. The young women of the present day found both all
ready for use in the jewel-chests of their grandmothers. It seems
likely, too, that there will presently be a revival of the costly
shoulder-clasps which used to be the fashion in the time of the
Empire, and if this be the case, the new fancy will probably, to
some extent, oust the belt buckle from popular favour. In the
designing of ornaments for the neck, art jewellers have far more
scope than formerly for the exercise of their imagination, and they
are disposed, to some extent, to follow the French mode, that is to
say, they make necklaces flat and broad, so as to give an effect of
slenderness to the throat of the wearer. It is a matter of course
that combs and pins for the hair are often of very fine workmanship,
showing much skill and taste on the part of their designers.
Strange to say, however, even in Vienna, few rings for women of
real art value are produced. In certain cases, however, the pendants
in gold relief, in crystal, or in enamel, are of pleasing, though not
particularly original design.</p>

<p>Working in enamel is of course an independent art in itself,
and to begin with, I must remark that, as a general rule, beautiful
as are the colour effects produced by Viennese craftsmen, it is
impossible to reproduce exactly the delicate charm of the original
sketches from which the designs are worked out. Very good results
can, however, be obtained in what the French call <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">émail à jour</i>, or
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">émail translucide</i>, as well as in the old-fashioned opaque enamel. It
would, however, be out of place here to attempt to describe the
various modifications of what may now be called an international
art.</p>

<p>Gustav Gurschner is a sculptor <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>. His fingers
are accustomed to moulding clay or plaster designs in such a manner
as to be readily reproduced in bronze. His slim and graceful
statuettes holding candles or gongs, and other artistically designed
objects for household use, have all a distinctly Viennese character.
His charming nude figures are full alike of childlike innocence and
nervous strength, and are moreover instinct with the spiritual
expression which naturally belonged to their originals. Gurschner's
designs for jewellery have very much the same effect upon a true
judge. The great thing distinguishing his work from that of his
contemporaries is the fact that it is modelled from the living figure,
not as is generally the case, from mere water-colour sketches. The
difference cannot fail to strike the most superficial observer.
Elsewhere, colour is often the chief consideration; with Gurschner
it is form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>In modern decorative work, silver is now very largely used and
appreciated. It is her skilful use of this material which has won so
high a position for Elsa Unger, a daughter of the wonderfully
successful etcher, Professor William Unger. Elsa Unger has a very
great predilection for silver, and has attained to rare skill in expressing
herself in that material. She herself knows perfectly well how to
deal with it at every stage of its progress as art material. She can
hammer it out and chisel it; she can engrave it, and combine with
it beautiful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">émail à jour</i> of soft, harmonious colouring. One of the
most noteworthy peculiarities of Elsa Unger's work is, indeed, her
mastery of her material. She is not content, as are unfortunately
most of her contemporaries, with delegating to others the working
out of her designs, but she herself sees to every detail, doing all the
work with her own hands. Some of her articles, such as gentlemen's
studs and sleeve-links, in beaten silver, relieved with blue enamel,
are alike simple and elegant, and have the rare advantage of being
also cheap.</p>

<p>With Elsa Unger may be classed another woman worker in silver,
Anna Wagner, who has produced amongst other tasteful work a
beautiful silver buckle, relieved with enamel. Amongst men who have
won a reputation as skilful workers in silver maybe named E. Holzinger
and Franz Mesmer, who were trained in the same institution as Elsa
Unger and Anna Wagner, the School of Art Craftsmanship connected
with the Museum of Vienna, well known for the thoroughness of
the instruction given in it. In this academy, which was thoroughly
reformed a few years ago, and is now under the able direction of
Baron Myrbach, the students learn to esteem skill in art craftsmanship
as it deserves, and become thoroughly familiar with the materials
employed in it. In the course of their training, feeling for true
beauty and elegance is mixed, so to speak, with their very blood,
becoming part of their natures, so that they cannot go far wrong.
Look, for instance, at some of the combs made by Elsa Unger. How
delicately harmonised are the beaten silver and the pale lilac-coloured
enamel, and how well the gracefully curving lines of the two
materials blend with and melt into each other! How chastely
effective, moreover, is the way in which the leaf-motive is worked out
in the pins for the hair designed by Mesmer, and what a happy
thought it was to make the many-coloured half-jewels, or jewels of
minor value, emerge as they do from the beaten silver. These works
are, moreover, a very striking example of how necessity may
sometimes become a virtue. The cheapness of material, so essential
in an educational establishment, has not been allowed to detract in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[7]</a></span>
the very slightest degree from the beauty of the work produced; so
that it is possible to have a real work of art, of which but few
examples are produced, at a very low price&mdash;say from about thirty-five
shillings; and that work is not a machine-made article, but one
the production of which, by his or her own hand, has been a true
labour of love to the designer, marking a real progress in art culture.</p>

<p>To the Technical Academy of Vienna the architect, Otto
Prutscher, and the painter, V. Schoenthoner, also owe much, but
the charm of their work consists rather in its colour than in its
form. Much is to be hoped in the future from both of these
talented artists, and what they have already produced proves that
there has been no sacrifice of individuality, no cramping of special
tendencies, such as is so much to be deprecated elsewhere, in the
training they have received.</p>

<p>Otto Prutscher's necklaces and rings are remarkable alike
for the beauty and harmonious variety of their colouring. He uses
enamel to a great extent, and also quite small precious stones.
Very uncommon, too, is the way in which he employs metal, though
only enough of it to hold the enamel in its place. It would appear
as if the artist had in his mind a vision of the women who are to
wear his work, who are too tender and frail to carry any weight,
so that the use of much metal in ornaments for them would be
quite unsuitable. For a Salome or a Queen of Sheba that sort of
thing is scarcely appropriate&mdash;but it is done for the softly nurtured
Mignonne of the present day. The little coloured pins designed
by F. Schoenthoner are also noticeable for their elegance and suitability
for the purpose for which they are intended.</p>

<p>A word of unstinted praise must be accorded to the graceful
designs of the talented Fräulein Eugenie Munk, whose skill and
good taste have been devoted to the production of a great deal of very
beautiful and refined jewellery.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the work in diamonds of Roset and
Fischmeister, and I should like to refer to those two master
craftsmen again in connection with some of their figural ornaments,
such as buckles for belts, rings, studs for shirt fronts and cuffs, etc.,
worked in dull or bright gold, all of which I consider worthy to
be spoken of as Viennese works of art. The different masks on
the studs, each with its own individual expression, really display
quite remarkable talent in their designer, for they are not only
thoroughly artistic but most amusing studies in physiognomy.
Unfortunately it is impossible to give in reproductions of such work
any true idea of the subtle manner in which the blue-green colours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[8]</a></span>
of the enamels, the gleaming white of the diamonds, and the pearly
opaline tints of the moonstones, harmonize with each other and with
the gold of their setting in the beautiful necklaces of Messrs. Roset
and Fischmeister. The watch-chains for men, with their finely-modelled
and characteristic ornaments, manufactured by the firm of
F. Hofstetter, must also be mentioned on account of the skill with
which the links are interwoven. The pendant is designed from a
sketch made by Professor Stephan Schwartz. Two other designs
from the same firm show very considerable skill.</p>

<p>Very interesting is the way in which the materials are combined
in the belt-buckles by Franz Hauptmann. The water-lily buckle is
of greenish gold, and the enamel, which is of the translucid variety,
is also of a green hue, as are the onyx stones worked into the
design. The motive is the flower and seed of the water-lily, and
from the water, represented in enamel, rise up the delicate flowers
in the same material of a snowy whiteness.</p>

<p>An examination of the sketches of designs for jewellery, reproduced
here, cannot fail to bring one fact forcibly before the mind.
Mechanical repetition is most carefully avoided, and as a result every
example retains its own unique charm&mdash;the mark of the artist's hand. <span class="rightmove"><span class="smcap">W. Fred</span>.</span></p>

<h2><a name="MODERN_GERMAN_JEWELLERY" id="MODERN_GERMAN_JEWELLERY"></a>MODERN GERMAN JEWELLERY.<br />
<span class="smcap">By</span> CHR. FERDINAND MORAWE.</h2>

<p><span class="float1" style="width: 137px;">
<img src="images/drop-m.png" alt="M" class="floatl" height="140" width="137" /></span><span class="hidden">M</span>Y opportunities of surveying the German
jewellery market, and of making
acquaintance with the ins and outs of
the jewellers' business, have been limited;
but it is certain that both are flourishing;
at least, the German jewellers do not
look as if they starved! Moreover, the
demand for precious ornaments seems to
increase year by year, and the display in
the jewellers' windows grows more and
more luxurious, as is the case with most
other businesses. Nobody will store
superfluous and unmarketable goods, least of all the jeweller, who
is always a business man. You will be thoroughly aware of this
fact if you start discussing art with him. He is cautious and
suspicious of anything in the shape of novelty. He seems to
say to himself: "This artist has ideas; he wants to show something
new; but we cannot agree with these ideas, for we do
not know if we shall be able to do business." This is a great
pity, for the trade in women's ornaments offers more artistic
scope than almost any other. It is not enough nowadays just to
set some nicely polished stones neatly, or to be so lavish of material
that the ornament produced represents an immense value; for the
result will probably be something not at all artistic. Indeed, this
generally occurs. The lot of the artist who designs women's
ornaments is not a happy one, and it is almost like a message from
heaven when a jeweller tells him that he will really condescend to
carry out an original design. Even then he must sometimes put up
with the fact that his design, which was intended for one person or
purpose only, is repeated, like a manufactured article, a hundred and
a thousand times again.</p>

<p>Happily there are some artists in Germany, as in England, France,
and Belgium, who are above the fashion, and whose artistic individuality
is so strong that they are bound to succeed in other spheres
of art as well as in that of women's jewellery.</p>

<p>Two of the first to show activity in this direction were the Berlin
artists, Hirzel and Möhring. Both chose for their ornaments the
same manner and methods which Eckmann and his fellow-workers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[2]</a></span>
had previously employed in decorative art; they adhered as closely
as possible to simple natural plant-forms, especially Hirzel. Thallmayr,
of Munich, is still working in the same style, but with more
individuality than Hirzel. Thallmayr will certainly spend his life
studying the leaves and blossoms of the trees and the flowers in
his garden, while the other will doubtless produce new results,
departing somewhat from the real forms of nature. Möhring's
works already showed this tendency when he produced them nearly
at the same time as Hirzel his. Subsequently these artists were
occupied less with women's ornaments than with other things
coming within the category of decorative art,&mdash;this owing to lack of
intelligence and enterprise on the part of the jewellers and manufacturers.
Tables, chairs, and other necessary household articles
found a much wider market. But we are now dealing exclusively
with women's ornaments. Two circumstances in this connection
are very strange. In the first place, it seems that the artists of the
present time (I speak of Germany) are not successful in designing
finger-rings. Here and there one sees an attempt made to design
characteristic shapes, but the sphere of the ring is so confined that
nobody has succeeded in producing anything really elegant and
novel. Mostly one sees extravagant examples, of confused design.
The second peculiar fact is, that one very seldom finds an artist
devoting himself to designing earrings. The whole artistic movement
in relation to women's ornaments is still somewhat puerile.
This may be recognised by the absence of the ear-ring, that most
superior ornament, which, unlike all others, has an independent
language of its own. Although in the list of female ornaments the
clasp and the brooch occupy the foremost place, the pendant for
the breast should not be forgotten. The mission of the pendant
is to show by its fancy and its tastefulness how and in what
degree the German is distinguished from the Englishman and from
the Frenchman.</p>

<p>I will mention in this connection two artists living in Germany
who are not Germans, but by their manner of life and work might
be such. Both these artists, in their several ways, will exercise
great influence on the development of our ornaments. I refer to
Van der Velde and Olbrich. It is well known that the first is a
Belgian, while the other is a foreigner, inasmuch as he comes from
Austria.</p>

<p>Olbrich's pendants and pins are very characteristic. He takes
a hammered gold-plate, enriches it with precious stones and enamel,
and adds a rim set with long pearls. It is easy to see that he is fond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[3]</a></span>
rummaging among the treasures of the old cathedrals and convents;
he knows the secret of their effect, and, besides this, he has an
extraordinary talent for inventing new things himself. His
jewellery is the best we have now in Germany, because it
is superior to fashions and periods. His jewels are pure,
thoughtful works of art. When worn, they produce a most
sumptuous effect; but their richness has nothing tawdry about it.
These jewels show us how we ought to deck our wives, both at
home and at the theatre; moreover, they suggest things fit for the
lady superiors of religious orders, for abbesses, even for our queens.
They show us too how our burgomasters' chains, with their
insignificant crosses and stars, might be improved. These ideas are
perhaps at present as intangible as a beautiful dream, but that is no
reason why we should not indulge our fancy in this direction. For
the moment, however, we must be satisfied if the jeweller is inclined
to carry out our designs.</p>

<p>Looking further among our artists, we find Karl Gross, of
Dresden. Mr. Gross, who formerly lived in Munich, delighted us
while there with a good many beautiful designs for jewellery. He
produced not only female ornaments, but also paper-cutters, seals,
and so on. He always displayed good taste and a fine sense
of form, having, like Olbrich, the capacity to carry out his designs
quite independently, without consideration of his predecessors'
effects. A hair-pin of Gross's may be regarded as quite an
independent work, although it relies on an old tradition. Those
artists, indeed, show the most freedom who have adapted the
beautiful examples of past generations.</p>

<p>Examining our new jewellery, we find very little work which
has the appearance of having been done by a strong hand. Most of
it in time becomes unbearably monotonous. Still, it is something
that we in Germany have at least two artists who design in so fresh
and characteristic a manner that their works are always looked at
with the greatest interest. I already have mentioned them&mdash;Olbrich
and Van der Velde&mdash;and I fall back again upon them, though I have
already taken them in consideration.</p>

<p>We have other artists, too, who follow sound principles in other
branches of decorative art. One of the most individual of
these is Riemerschmid, of Munich. Others there are who are
nearly on the right way, but whose personal artistic sense is not
broad enough to make them produce something really good. This
general mention is, therefore, all their work demands.</p>

<p>In addition to finger and earrings our jewellery artists are responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[4]</a></span>
for other objects, such as the bracelet, the watch, and the fan. I
think it is very difficult to rescue the bracelet from conventionality.
We must hope the best for the future. But what about watch-cases,
especially those of ladies' watches? This art is quite neglected, not
so much by the manufacturers as by the artists. At this year's
Darmstadt Exhibition there were two watches displayed. One of
them had the case enamelled, if I mistake not, in the form of a
chrysanthemum, and on the other was modelled the figure of one of
the "Fates." The effect of the chrysanthemum watch was fairly
good, but the less said about the "Fate" the better. Why is it not
possible to design an ornament with taste and furnish it with
precious stones and enamel? It is the greatest pity that our
sculptors have no imagination. Having arrived at the determination
to think of a watch, the artist has no idea beyond depicting one
of the "Fates" with the thread and the scissors. I said just now that
the watch was neglected less by the manufacturers than by the
artists. Nowadays you may find watches indeed with gaily-coloured
cases, but the decorations are miserable, like everything else that is
invented by the manufacturers. They don't want to pay a good
price for the artist's sketch, and they are proud of the inspiration of
their own Muse. In this case one cannot avoid the conclusion that
the artists are themselves to blame for their neglect of this branch
of the jeweller's art.</p>

<p>The condition of affairs with regard to the fan is also very
astonishing. Why do our artists not supply our ladies with nice
fans? Please do not confound "nice" with "precious." The
fan as we know it now is so utterly "played out" that scarcely
anything can be done with it. New arrangements of the feathers
are invented; the handle is trimmed in different ways; new materials
are used, but a really new and artistic idea cannot be devised.
Titian's "Lady with the Fan" is admired; the fan is known very
well, but nobody thinks of making use of it. Meanwhile another
kind of fan is being more and more extensively employed. I
refer to the palm-leaf of the Japanese and the Chinese. People are
very fond of being fanned by these leaves, but nobody observes their
artistic possibilities. An artist who can afford to be independent of
mere fashion is therefore wanted to give new life to the fan. Such
an artist will win lasting success.</p>

<img src="images/drop-r.png" alt="R" class="floatl" height="140" width="120" /></span><span class="hidden">R</span>ECENT <em>Salons</em> in Belgium have been notoriously
unsuccessful, and it cannot be disputed
that the public is becoming less and less
interested in the large exhibitions of Fine
Arts. Notable artists have been conspicuously
absent; new works have been as scarce as old
ones have been abundant; and, lastly, the
general arrangements have been altogether
lacking in attractiveness. Despite the violent
opposition of interested persons, official and
otherwise, the type of display started some
time ago in Brussels by the "XX" club, and continued by the
"Libre Esthétique" and "Pour L'Art" societies, has succeeded
in attracting the attention of <em>connoisseurs</em> and art lovers generally,
with, apparently, every prospect of retaining it.</p>

<p>The combination of works of painting and sculpture with the
most exquisite productions of ceramic art, glass-ware, and all that is
most delicate in jewellery and goldsmith's work, adds a special
attraction to these exhibitions, which are always looked for with the
utmost interest. It is, indeed, the jewellers, who, among all our
Belgian art workers, have succeeded in making themselves and their
productions the best known and most widely appreciated; the more
so as in their case one was able to compare their works closely and determine
their relative merits. It may truly be said that their most
notable characteristic is diversity&mdash;a diversity which is shown, not
only by the amateurs, so to speak, but also among the professionals.</p>

<p>No remarks on Belgian sculpture&mdash;particularly in its decorative sense&mdash;are
complete without mention being made of Charles Van der
Stappen. True, he has executed but a small number of detached
ornaments, but in the arrangement of the hair in his exquisitely
fanciful busts he has lavished a wealth of fine modelling, the influence
of which is still widely felt.</p>

<p>In the works of M. Paul Dubois we discover the sculptor modelling
the details of his buckles and clasps as he would so many powerful
muscles. M. Fernand Dubois seems to be a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chercheur</i> of a more
subtle kind; but this very excess of ingenuity sometimes mars the
plastic effect of his jewels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>From Victor Rousseau we have had so far nothing more than a
gold bracelet. The subject is quite simple&mdash;two hands holding a
pearl; but the work is in every way worthy of the young Brussels
artist, whom I regard as one of the most remarkable personalities in
the domain of contemporary Belgian sculpture.</p>

<p>The decorator Van de Velde, who has left Brussels, and is now
settled in Berlin, exhibited at some of the "Libre Esthétique" <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salons</i>
a series of jewels remarkable for their firm and consistent construction.</p>

<p>The jewels displayed recently by M. Feys are distinguished by
grace and felicitous appropriateness; but even more striking is the
perfection of their execution, which is really extraordinary in its
suggestion of suppleness.</p>

<p>Other jewels displayed recently at the "Libre Esthétique" by
M. Morren and Mlle. de Bronckère also deserve notice.</p>

<p>In the course of a very interesting study on M. Ph. Wolfers,
M. Sander Pièrron, the sagacious Brussels critic, thus described
the work of this remarkable specialist in the "Revue des Arts
Décoratifs":&mdash;</p>

<p>"M. Wolfers seeks his inspiration in the study of the nature
and the forms of his marvellous domain, and his vision of things is
specially defined in his jewels. The detail therein contributes
largely to the spirit of the entire work, which borrows its character
from the decoration itself or from the subject of that decoration.
He never allows himself to stray into the regions of fancy; at most,
he permits his imagination to approach the confines of ornamental
abstraction. Nevertheless, he interprets Nature, but is never
dominated by it. He has too true, too exact a sense of the
decorative principle to conform to the absolute reality of the things
he admires and reproduces. His art, by virtue of this rule, is thus
a modified translation of real forms. He has too much taste to
introduce into the composition of one and the same jewel flowers or
animals which have no parallel symbol or, at least, some family
likeness or significance. He will associate swans with water-lilies&mdash;the
flowers which frame, as it were, the life of those grand poetic
birds; or he will put the owl or the bat with the poppy&mdash;that triple
evocation of Night and Mystery; or the heron with the eel&mdash;symbols
of distant, melancholy streams. He rightly judges that in
art one must endeavour to reconcile everything, both the idea and
the materials whereby one tries to make that idea live and speak.
Inspired, doubtless, by the fact that the ancients chose black stones
for the carving of the infernal or fatal deities, M. Wolfers uses a
dark amethyst for his owls, which gives them a special significance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[3]</a></span>
The Grecians used the aqua-marina exclusively for the engraving of
their marine gods, by reason of its similarity to the colour of the sea,
just as they never carved the features of Bacchus in anything but
amethyst&mdash;that stone whose essence suggests the purple flow
of wine."</p>

<p>M. van Strydonck expresses himself to me in the following
terms on the subject of his art:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am of opinion that the jewel can be produced without the aid
of stones, enamels, etc. I do not exclude them entirely, but they
should not be used unless it be to give the finishing touch, or
occasionally to relieve an <em>ensemble</em> lacking in vigour of colour.
My preference is for oxydations, for in general effect they are more
harmonious to the eye, and by careful seeking one can find all the
tones required. I think you will share my opinion that it is much
easier to use enamels, by means of which one's object is instantly
attained. Yet it is seldom one produces a beautiful symphony of
colour. Enamel can only be employed in small quantities. Why?
Because, in the first place, he who uses it must have a profound
knowledge of colours and a special colourist's eye; he must
remember, moreover, that he is appealing to a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">clientèle</i> composed
principally of ladies, who in most cases regard the jewel simply as a
means to complete such and such a toilette.</p>

<p>"It seems to me, indeed," continues M. van Strydonck, "that
translucent enamel is the most suitable because it simply serves as
an auxiliary&mdash;a basis necessary to the completion of the <em>ensemble</em>&mdash;and
adds value to workmanship and design; and there is nothing to
prevent its alliance with the beautiful oxydations which come almost
naturally from gold."</p>

<p>Note how, little by little, enamel is being abandoned in favour of
stones, such as onyx, agate, and malachite, materials of no special
value, which can be cut in different ways, and whose colour gives
fine effects infinitely preferable to those of inferior enamels.</p>

<p>Of course, I do not despise the fine stone, which, by its bold colour,
often relieves the work, but this is not altogether the object of the
jewel, unless profit be the sole object of the maker; and I ought to
add that the revival of the jewel in recent years has not been
favourably regarded by certain firms, who saw therein a distinct
diminution of gain, the fact being that their large stock of fine
stones&mdash;beautiful in themselves, but out of place in works such as I
have mentioned&mdash;threatens to remain on their hands.</p>

<p>One cannot truly say that Belgian <em>eventaillistes</em> exist, for it is only
very occasionally that such water-colour painters as MM. Cassiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[4]</a></span>
Stacquet, and Uytterschaut carry out their delightful landscapes and
seascapes in the shape required for a fan.</p>

<p>Something has been done in lacework in connection with the
fan, and on this point I should mention in terms of praise M. Van
Cutsem, a Brussels designer, who has made numerous models for
M. Bart and M. Sacré, amongst which may be noted several happy
experiments in the direction of the "modern style."</p>

<p>To conclude, let me refer to the lace by Mlle. Bienaimé, admirably
mounted by M. Goosens, of Brussels.</p>

<h2><a name="MODERN_DANISH_JEWELLERY" id="MODERN_DANISH_JEWELLERY"></a>MODERN DANISH JEWELLERY.<br />

<span class="smcap">By</span> GEORG BROCHNER.</h2>

<p><span class="float1" style="width: 126px;">
<img src="images/drop-e.png" alt="E" class="floatl" height="140" width="126" /></span><span class="hidden">E</span>MANATING from England&mdash;and, I am
tempted to add, with <span class="smcap">The Studio</span> for its
pioneer&mdash;the new movement, the rejuvenation,
the second Renaissance, or whatever
one may be pleased to call it, in matters of
Fine, and more especially Applied Art, is
like a mighty wave making its way over
many lands. But, as with the waves of
the ocean, its movements are often fitful and
impulsive, its progress irregular and spasmodic.
Why this is so it is often futile to
speculate upon, and even where a plausible explanation is apparently
near at hand, it may on closer investigation prove more or less of a
fallacy. Thus it may appear natural enough that a small country
should be unable to vie with large and rich empires in the matter of
jewellery, for the making of such is likely to entail expenditure out
of proportion to the buying capacity of smaller nations. Yet this
argument really does not hold good, for inasmuch as in modern
jewellery it is more the design and conception, more the intrinsic
artistic value and the proper choice and handling of the material
which are the main things (and not the quantity of precious stones
used), the cost need by no means be excessive. For day wear, at
least, delightful jewellery is now made entirely from gold and silver,
and enamel, and even bronze, possessing decorative properties immeasurably
beyond those of the far more costly articles produced up
to only a few years ago.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the fructifying effects of these new ideas have, on
the whole, been somewhat slow in making themselves felt within
the craft of the gold and the silver-smith, or, rather, within that
branch of it which embraces articles for personal adornment. Some
countries have so far ignored them altogether; in others they are only
just beginning to take root. In Denmark, for instance, which in
other fields of applied art holds such an honourably prominent
position, comparatively little attention has hitherto been given to
jewellery by those distinguished artists who have for years brought
their talent to bear upon other crafts. But, if I mistake not, a
change is beginning to manifest itself in this respect, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[2]</a></span>
very little doubt that the material for an article on modern Danish
jewellery will be vastly augmented within a span of but a few
years, although it is unfortunately a little scanty at the time of
writing.</p>

<p>Bindesböll, whose characteristic style is so easily recognised,
has some good clasps and brooches to his credit. They are
distinguished by that unconventional boldness and freedom which
one always hails with unmixed pleasure wherever one finds them,
whether it be on a book-cover, on a sofa cushion, on a metal
vessel, or in some architectural decoration. It is only very rarely
Bindesböll deigns to employ a distinct figure or motif in his designs,
but, in spite of a capriciousness in his lines&mdash;a capriciousness which
at times borders upon recklessness&mdash;the effect is almost invariably
harmonious and decorative.</p>

<p>Of a totally different stamp is Harald Slott-Möller, to whom is due
the place of honour when dealing with modern Danish jewellery.
His designs are carefully conceived and they almost invariably illustrate
a fine poetic idea or allegory, always happily chosen. They are
somewhat elaborate, both in details and drawing, and in the choice
of material, with regard to which he is rather extravagant than
otherwise. His jewellery is possessed of a distinguished decorative
beauty, and although he is entirely original, both in his choice of
motifs and in his way of dealing with them, it might perhaps not
be very difficult to trace certain English influences in his work.
He is himself a skilful craftsman, whilst some of his designs have
been executed at the famous establishment of Mr. Michelsen,
Danish Court jeweller. For one of Mr. Michelsen's daughters,
Slott-Möller designed the exceedingly beautiful brooch of which we
give an illustration (Plate 4). It is made of silver, which is strongly
oxidised, with blue, white, and green enamel. The stars are set in
diamonds, and the pendants at the side are pearls. The comb with
the butterflies on the lyre is the property of another sister, and is
made of tortoise-shell and gold, with enamel, set with pearls,
diamonds, and sapphires. A second comb, likewise made of
tortoise-shell, has for its decorative motif a mermaid, gold, enamel,
and coral being used with no mean skill. In the necklace the myth
of Helen is represented. The central portion is of dark oxidised
silver, with flames and sparks in gold, the walls of burning Troy and
the grass are enamel, and the figure of Helen is carved in ivory.
On the side plates men fight and die, illustrating the inscription, in
Greek: "She brought devastation, she gave fame." Slott-Möller
has himself made the whole of this elaborate and charming necklace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[3]</a></span>
The hand-mirror is made in silver, with an ivory handle, in the
likeness of a candle, round the flame of which a number of luckless
moths flutter; the moths and the ooze from the candle are oxidised.</p>

<p>Moyens Bollin, who has lately gone in for the making of
artistic metal objects, has also designed several pretty combs, clasps,
etc., made in silver or bronze. In the former material is a clasp, of
which we give an illustration, with flowers in blossom and bud,
admirably drawn so as to fill their allotted space. Another clasp, a
butterfly, is in bronze.</p>

<p>Erick Magnussen is a very young artist, who seems to give
promise. The "1901" in the pendant mirror is very deftly drawn,
covering its space evenly and well, as does also the design of the
"Fish" clasp illustrated. The other, with the mermaids, shows
that he can also successfully employ the female form for decorative
purposes.</p>

<p>A silver clasp and brooch by Niels Dyrlund are distinguished
by a quaint but well balanced intertwining of lines, the effect
produced being pleasing and decorative, and Einar Nielsen, the
talented painter, Axel Hou, and Georg Jensen have also recently
taken to the designing of clasps and such like objects.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
